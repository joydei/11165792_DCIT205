PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITE
The reason for the creation of the website is to help me gain an insight into how websites are made for organizations and also learn what and where to use various elements inside the code to help shape and bring out the best in a webpage. It's been quite fun creating this site since I learnt how to use new gimmicks to twist and turn the website to my choice of preference. It also made me understand the kind of intellectual mind needed to take on such a herculean task and also made me appreciate websites I saw, since now I've experienced a fraction of the stress they are put on every single day.
